<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 25, 2025</p>

<p>
SkillNJob (“the App”) is provided by an individual developer, Manjunath Reddy. 
This Privacy Policy explains what information the App collects, how it is used and shared, and your choices.
</p>

<h2>Non-affiliation disclaimer</h2>
<p>
SkillNJob is not a government app and is not affiliated with any government entity. 
The App aggregates publicly available listings and links you to the official website for each post so you can verify details there.
</p>

<h2>Information I collect</h2>
<p>The App does not require you to create an account. 
The App does not intentionally collect sensitive personal data (such as financial, health, or precise location data).</p>

<p><strong>a) Device and app information (non-personal):</strong> device model, operating system version, app version, preferred language/region, basic crash and diagnostic data, and network status.</p>

<p><strong>b) Usage data (non-personal):</strong> aggregated events such as screens viewed and basic interaction metrics used to improve performance and user experience.</p>

<p><strong>c) Advertising identifiers:</strong> advertising partners (such as Google AdMob) may collect the device’s mobile Advertising ID and related signals to show and measure ads.</p>

<p><strong>d) Push notifications (optional):</strong> if you opt in, a device token (via Firebase Cloud Messaging) is generated to deliver notifications. You can disable notifications anytime.</p>

<p><strong>e) Support communications (optional):</strong> if you contact me by email, I receive your email address and message content.</p>

<h2>How I use information</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Operate and improve app features.</li>
    <li>Diagnose crashes, fix bugs, and secure the App.</li>
    <li>Deliver and measure advertising.</li>
    <li>Send notifications you have enabled.</li>
    <li>Respond to support requests.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sharing and third parties</h2>
<p>I do not sell your personal information. Limited data is shared with service providers:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> app infrastructure, notifications, deep links.</li>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> advertising and measurement.</li>
    <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> hosting/database for app content.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Partner policies:</strong><br>
<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a><br>
<a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">Google Ads Technologies</a>
</p>

<h2>Links to official websites</h2>
<p>
Posts in the App contain links to official websites (government portals, universities, company sites). 
External websites are governed by their own privacy policies.
</p>

<h2>Data retention</h2>
<p>
Diagnostic and usage data are retained only as long as needed, then aggregated or deleted. 
Support emails are kept only as long as required to resolve your request or meet legal obligations.
</p>

<h2>Your choices and rights</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Reset or limit the Advertising ID in Android settings.</li>
    <li>Turn off ad personalization where available.</li>
    <li>Enable/disable notifications in device settings.</li>
    <li>Request deletion of your support emails via email.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
I use industry-standard safeguards such as TLS encryption. No system is 100% secure, 
but I work to protect your information.
</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p>
The App is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child shared data, contact me for deletion.
</p>

<h2>International transfers</h2>
<p>
Service providers may process data on servers outside your country. By using the App, you consent to such transfers.
</p>

<h2>Legal bases for EEA/UK users</h2>
<p>
I process non-personal data under legitimate interest to operate and improve the App. 
Where required, I rely on your consent (e.g., personalized ads, notifications).
</p>

<h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
<p>
I may update this Policy periodically. Any updates will appear here with a new “Last updated” date.
